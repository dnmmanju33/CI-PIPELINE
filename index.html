        <p> The index.html page is the most common name used for the default page shown on a website if no other page is specified when a visitor requests the site. In other words, index.html is the name used for the homepage of the website.</p>
        
        <p>Websites are built inside of directories on a web server. Just like you have folders on your computer that you save files into, you do the same with a web server by adding your website files, including HTML pages, images, scripts, CSS, and more - basically all the individual building blocks of your site. You can name directories based on the content they will contain. For example, websites commonly include a directory labeled "images" which contains all the graphic files used for the website.</p>
        
        <p>For your website, you will need to save each webpage as a separate file. For example, your "About Us" page may be saved as about.html and your "Contact Us" page may be contact.html. Your site will be comprised of these .html documents.</p>
        
        <p>Other Default Page Names Besides index.html, there are other default page names that some sites use, including:
            index.htm
            default.htm or default.html
            home.htm or home.html
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Whenever you have a directory on your website, it is a best practice to have a correspondingpage. This allows your readers to see a page when they come to that directory without typing a file name in the URL, preventing them from seeing a. Even if you do not plan to display content on the index pages of select directories with any actual page links, having the file in place is a smart user experience move, as well as a security feature.
